# Intro
Hi, my name is Alperen. I'm a senior year computer engineering student from Turkey. 

# Why
Today, we wake up to a world of software in the morning. Our cars, houses, cities, all of them are possible via software. 
Unfortunately, the people behind these products are prone to mistakes. When your phone app crashes, when your browser window goes haywire, these mistakes are acceptable. 
But software bugs in what we call safety-critical industries such as avionics, automotives, medicine or nuclear-energy, cost lives. 
If the brake system of car a fails, a Computer Aided Design tool makes a faulty calculation resulting in a bridge collapsing, people suffer from these mistakes in grave manner. 

# What
For 2 years now, I have been working on PVL, Protocol Verification Language. 
PVL is an open source programming language that allows researchers, companies and programmers to write programs with correctness guarantees. 

# How
In PVL, we use a technique called formal verification to ensure correctness of programs. 
Software engineers can specify various properties in their programs, PVL compiler checks the correctness of the program with respect to the given specifications. 
Writing a formal mathematical specification is not easy, yet many industry standarts are starting to require formal specification for software products used in safety-critical industries. 
We believe that moving from traditional techniques to formal verification is not going to be easy, and that we can help make this change faster, easier and more reliable.

# Why PVL not Others

There exists other methods of software verification such as automated testing or static program analysis, even other methods using formal verification. 
But these methods are working on environments or programming languages designed in the past. 
With PVL, we are creating a programming environment that you can write your programs, write your specifications, verify your programs and have a correct working executable at the end. 
We believe that uniyfing this process in a single pipeline is going to make software verification easier and more trustworthy.

# Now
We are currently working on PVL as a team 4, an alpha version of the programming language is on its way very soon. We expect and value your feedback and support. 
I offer my kindest regards to all of you listening to me, thank you.
